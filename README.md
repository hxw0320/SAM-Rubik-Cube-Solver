# This is the code for our project: Rubikâ€™s Cube Solver: Integrating SAM and A Search for Automated Solution

In order to running this code, you need download the [SAM2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2)

And then you need put them under the [notebooks](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2/tree/main/notebooks) folder.

Our solver has two option, use Segment Anything (SAM) to segment [image]([https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2/tree/main/notebooks](https://github.com/hxw0320/SAM-Rubik-Cube-Solver/blob/main/notebooks/rubiks_cube_image.ipynb
) or [video]([https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2/tree/main/notebooks](https://github.com/hxw0320/SAM-Rubik-Cube-Solver/blob/main/notebooks/rubiks_cube_video.ipynb
) to identify the coloured squares and hence cube configuration.
